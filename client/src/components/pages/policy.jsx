            Tilok is a people-to-people platform---we are of the people, by the
            people and for the people---that provides economic empowerment by
            bringing real benefits to those who share their homes. Founded in
            2008, Airbnb is democratizing capitalism by expanding the economic
            pie for ordinary people , allowing them to use their home, typically
            their greatest expense, to generate supplemental income to pay for
            costs like food, rent, and their children's education. Hosts keep 97
            percent of the price they charge for listing their homes. The
            typical US host earns the equivalent of a 14-percent annual raise.

            Working together, platforms like Airbnb can help governments collect

            Home sharing can deliver benefits to tenants, homeowners and
            landlords in every corner of every community. Airbnb has created a

            Some cities have rules regarding how many listings a host can have.
            Some cities require extra steps to be taken by hosts with more than
            one listing, and some cities place limits on the overall number of
            listings a host can share. Requiring permits after a certain number
            of listings Under this approach, hosts are required to register with
            the jurisdiction based on the number of local listings they maintain
            on home sharing platforms. Jersey City hosts, for example, are only
            required to register with the city after listing more than five
            units. When a host exceeds the limit, he or she is treated as a
            professional and must get the appropriate business licenses and meet
            zoning requirements. In Europe, similar rules are in effect in Milan
            and Vienna.
